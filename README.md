# Cryptocurrency Exchange API Integration and Trading Platform Development

It is the 24 hrs project assigned during data engineering apprenticeship program at Coderush.
Question: 
Cryptocurrency Exchange API Integration and Trading Platform Development
Your objective is to build a web-based trading platform for cryptocurrencies that integrates with a
cryptocurrency exchange API. The platform should provide real-time market data, enable users to place
buy/sell orders, and track their portfolio. Your tasks include:
- Choose a reputable cryptocurrency exchange API and familiarize yourself with its
documentation, authentication mechanisms, and available trading endpoints.
- Develop backend functionality to fetch real-time market data, handle user authentication, process
buy/sell orders, and retrieve portfolio information.
- Design and implement a responsive frontend interface that displays market data, allows users to
place orders, and shows their portfolio performance. Implement real-time updates for price
changes and order status.
- Consider security measures such as implementing two-factor authentication, protecting sensitive
user information, and handling API rate limits.



In this project, I have develop a flask application using HTML and CSS that allows users to buy and sell stocks. The application will allow users to register, login, logout, get stock quotes, buy and sell stocks, view history of transactions, and see their portfolio.
